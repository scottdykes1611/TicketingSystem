To use the website, just open TicketingSystem/Pages/Auth/login.html in a browser (I mainly used chrome)

There are 3 logins for the site

Basic User logins:
 - username: "user@email.com"
 - password: "password"

 - username: "lochei001@dundee.ac.uk"
 - password: "password"

Admin User login:
 - username: "admin@email.com"
 - password: "password"
